                            Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                            If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ( { } ), it exists in the <strong>global scope.</strong> The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks. <strong>Local Scope :</strong> In contrast to global variables, locally scoped ones are only visible within the function they are declared. Each function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and every variable declared in this scope is a local variable. That means that variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

                        <div class="content">
                            The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                        <div class="content">
                            Undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.
